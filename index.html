The Little Red Hen version by Paul Galdone
The little red hen is looking for help from some other animals. She'd like their help growing and collecting wheat, but they all refuse to help her. She ends up doing it all alone. But when the hen shows the other animals what she's made with the wheat - a delicious cake - they all want to have a piece. The animals learn an important lesson when the hen eats the cake all by herself. After all, they didn't help make the cake, so why should they get to help eat the cake?

When you teach this story, you can have your students follow along to determine what steps are taken when growing wheat. Your students can create a step-by-step diagram for growing wheat. You might continue the step-by-step guides by having your students make a recipe for a cake.</p></section>
